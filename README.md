# Breakdance Better Menu

Enhances the functionality of Breakdance's dropdown menus on mobile devices. Traditionally, clicking a link or arrow within the menu triggers the dropdown to either open or close. With this modification, selecting a link directly navigates the user to the specified page, while the arrow retains its original purpose of toggling the dropdown's visibility. Additionally, if a link is unassigned (empty) or specifically set to "#" (indicating a placeholder link), it will instead behave like the arrow, allowing the dropdown to open or close. This provides a more intuitive and user-friendly navigation experience on mobile devices.
Additionally, it applies an "active" class to the dropdown if it contains a link to the current page, visually indicating the active state.
